<text><loc_47><loc_165><loc_244><loc_249>This paper describes Tacotron 2, a neural network architecture for speech synthesis directly from text. The system is composed of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mean-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize time-domain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F$_{0}$ features. We further show that using this compact acoustic intermediate representation allows for a significant reduction in the size of the WaveNet architecture.</text>

<text><loc_47><loc_282><loc_244><loc_353>Generating natural speech from text (text-to-speech synthesis, TTS) remains a challenging task despite decades of investigation [1]. Over time, different techniques have dominated the field. Concatenative synthesis with unit selection, the process of stitching small units of pre-recorded waveforms together [2, 3] was the state-of-the-art for many years. Statistical parametric speech synthesis [4, 5, 6, 7], which directly generates smooth trajectories of speech features to be synthesized by a vocoder, followed, solving many of the issues that concatenative synthesis had with boundary artifacts. However, the audio produced by these systems often sounds muffled and unnatural compared to human speech.</text>
<text><loc_47><loc_353><loc_244><loc_399>WaveNet [8], a generative model of time domain waveforms, produces audio quality that begins to rival that of real human speech and is already used in some complete TTS systems [9, 10, 11]. The inputs to WaveNet (linguistic features, predicted log fundamental frequency ( F$_{0}$ ), and phoneme durations), however, require significant domain expertise to produce, involving elaborate text-analysis systems as well as a robust lexicon (pronunciation guide).</text>
<text><loc_47><loc_399><loc_244><loc_446>Tacotron [12], a sequence-to-sequence architecture [13] for producing magnitude spectrograms from a sequence of characters, simplifies the traditional speech synthesis pipeline by replacing the production of these linguistic and acoustic features with a single neural network trained from data alone. To vocode the resulting magnitude spectrograms, Tacotron uses the Griffin-Lim algorithm [14] for phase estimation, followed by an inverse short-time Fourier transform. As</text>

<text><loc_257><loc_156><loc_457><loc_174>the authors note, this was simply a placeholder for future neural vocoder approaches, as Griffin-Lim produces characteristic artifacts and lower audio quality than approaches like WaveNet.</text>
<text><loc_257><loc_174><loc_457><loc_220>In this paper, we describe a unified, entirely neural approach to speech synthesis that combines the best of the previous approaches: a sequence-to-sequence Tacotron-style model [12] that generates mel spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet vocoder [10, 15]. Trained directly on normalized character sequences and corresponding speech waveforms, our model learns to synthesize natural sounding aspect of speech that is difficult to distinguish from real human speech.</text>
<text><loc_257><loc_220><loc_457><loc_260>Deep Voice 3 [11] describes a similar approach. However, unlike our system, its naturalness has not been shown to rival that of human speech. Char2Wav [16] describes yet another similar approach to end-to-end TTS using a neural vocoder. However, they use different intermediate representations (traditional vocoder features) and their model architecture differs significantly.</text>

<text><loc_257><loc_280><loc_457><loc_320>Our proposed system consists of two components, shown in Figure 1 (1) a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network with attention which predicts a sequence of mel spectrogram frames from an input character sequence, and (2) a modified version of WaveNet which generates time-domain waveform samples conditioned on the predicted mel spectrogram frames.</text>

<text><loc_257><loc_339><loc_457><loc_378>In this work we choose a low-level acoustic representation: melfrequency spectrograms, to bridge the two components. Using a representation that is easily computed from time-domain waveforms allows us to train the two components separately. This representation is also smoother than waveform samples and is easier to train using a squared error loss because it is invariant to phase within each frame.</text>
<text><loc_257><loc_378><loc_457><loc_457>A mel-frequency spectrogram is related to the linear-frequency spectrogram, i.e., the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) magnitude. It is obtained by applying a nonlinear transform to the frequency axis of the STFT, inspired by measured responses from the human auditory system, and summarizes the frequency content with fewer dimensions. Using such an auditory frequency scale has the effect of emphasizing details in lower frequencies, which are critical to speech intelligibility, while de-emphasizing high frequency details, which are dominated by fricatives and other noise bursts and generally do not need to be modeled with high fidelity. Because of these properties, features derived from the mel scale have been used as an underlying representation for speech recognition for many decades [17].</text>
